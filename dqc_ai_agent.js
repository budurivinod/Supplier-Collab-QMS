* **High Business Volume:** A significant total business value indicates a strong, established relationship.

**Areas for Improvement:**
* **Delivery Timeliness:** The on-time delivery rate is below ideal. This suggests potential issues in their logistics or production planning that could impact project timelines.`;

**Quality Risk: Low**
* Justification: The quality approval rate is excellent, suggesting a very low risk of receiving defective or non-compliant parts.

**Concentration Risk: Medium-High**
* Justification: The total business value is substantial. Over-reliance on this supplier could be a risk if they face disruptions.

**Recommended Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Operational:** Collaborate with the supplier on improving their delivery forecasting. Consider holding a small buffer of safety stock for critical components.
* **Quality:** Continue standard receiving inspections. No immediate additional action is needed.
* **Concentration:** Begin identifying and qualifying at least one alternative supplier for key components to reduce dependency.`;

* **RFP 2:** The scope is more granular, specifically requesting the "design and fabrication of a 5-axis robotic arm" with detailed performance metrics.

**Deliverables:**
* **RFP 1:** Requires a functional prototype and documentation.
* **RFP 2:** Requires a functional prototype, full CAD models, stress analysis reports, and a maintenance manual.

**Summary:**
RFP 2 is significantly more detailed and provides clearer expectations for the supplier. While its timeline is more aggressive, the milestone-based approach reduces risk for both parties. RFP 1's ambiguity in scope and deliverables could lead to disputes later. RFP 2 is more favorable for a supplier who is confident in their technical capabilities and project management.`;
